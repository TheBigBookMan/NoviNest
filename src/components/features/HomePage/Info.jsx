                <p className='leading-relaxed'>At Novi Nest Psychology, we help families and educators gain meaningful insight into the developmental profiles of children in their care. Through evidence-based assessments, we aim to highlight each child's strengths while identifying the support they need to thrive.</p>

                <p className='leading-relaxed'>We believe assessments should be accessible to all. That's why, where possible, we conduct school-based assessments, allowing children to be seen in a familiar environment rather than a clinical setting. By reducing stress and increasing comfort, we ensure assessment outcomes that reflect your child's natural abilities and learning needs.</p>
                
                <p className='leading-relaxed'>Our reports go beyond numbersâ€”they provide clear, actionable recommendations that empower families and educators to support each child's development. At Novi Nest, our goal is simple: to foster understanding, unlock potential, and inform the way forward.</p>
