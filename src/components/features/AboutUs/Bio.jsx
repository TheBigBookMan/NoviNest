            <div className='flex flex-col gap-4 text-sm'>
                <p className='font-playfair text-base'>I started this practice because I'm passionate about helping families make sense of the unique minds of the children they love and care for, while empowering young people to embrace their strengths.</p>

                <p>I am a clinical psychologist with a background in both therapeutic and assessment-based roles across public and private sectors. My professional journey began as a youth worker, supporting children and adolescents living in residential care. As an early career psychologist, I worked with young people in the private practice space, before dedicating several years to the child protection system, both in a hospital-based role and working directly with families and children within the department. These experiences have shaped not only my clinical skills, but also my deep sense of empathy and commitment to supporting young people navigating complex systems.</p>

                <p>The name Novi Nest holds both personal and symbolic meaning. “Novi” means “new” in several European languages—a quiet nod to my heritage and my last name, Zinoviev. Novi Nest represents a place of new beginnings: where understanding grows, and change becomes possible. Like a nest, it offers a safe and steady foundation—where children and families are supported as they prepare for what comes next.</p>

                <p>After relocating from Adelaide to Sydney in early 2025, I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to offer support to the children and families here. It's a privilege to help ensure every young person receives the understanding, support, and opportunities they deserve to thrive in their learning and development.</p>
